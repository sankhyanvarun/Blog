                <h2>The Spark of an Idea</h2>
                <p>Have you ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through a clunky website, hunting for a single piece of information, and thinking, "There has to be a better way"? As a fourth-year engineering student specializing in AI and Machine Learning, that question sparked a fascination that has defined my academic journey. I saw a world full of repetitive, time-consuming tasks and realized that AI could be the key to unlocking a more efficient future for everyone. This isn't just about futuristic robots; it's about practical solutions for everyday problems. And I decided to build one myself.</p>

                <h2>The Problem: The Campus Information Maze</h2>
                <p>Every college student knows the struggle. You need to know the deadline for course registration, the date of the next big campus event, or the contact info for a specific department. The first stop is usually the college website—a digital labyrinth of menus, outdated pages, and broken links. This process is inefficient, frustrating, and a huge time sink for students, parents, and staff alike.</p>

                <h2>The Solution: An AI-Powered College Chatbot</h2>
                <p>To tackle this problem head-on, I developed a <strong>College Chatbot</strong>. Imagine a single point of contact, available 24/7, that holds all the knowledge of the college website and more. Instead of searching, you simply ask a question in plain English, and you get an answer in seconds.</p>

                <h2>A Look Under the Hood: The Tech Stack</h2>
                <p>For those interested in the technical details, this chatbot is powered by some exciting technology:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Brain:</strong> The core of the chatbot is the <strong>Mistral 7B</strong> model, a powerful Large Language Model.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Technique:</strong> I used <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> to ensure the bot provides factual, context-specific answers from a verified knowledge base.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Performance:</strong> The result is a highly responsive tool that handles most queries in <strong>under one to two minutes</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why It's a Game-Changer</h2>
                <p>The chatbot doesn't just replicate the website; it vastly improves upon it by providing instant, conversational support 24/7. It turns a frustrating search into a simple conversation.</p>
